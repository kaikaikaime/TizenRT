 * Name: pm_checkstate
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function is called from the MCU-specific IDLE loop to monitor the
 *   the power management conditions.  This function returns the "recommended"
 *   power management state based on the PM configuration.  The power management
 *   state is not automatically changed, however.  The IDLE loop must call
 *   pm_changestate() in order to make the state change.
 *
 *   These two steps are separated because the plaform-specific IDLE loop may
 *   have additional situational information that is not available to the
 *   the PM sub-system.  For example, the IDLE loop may know that the
 *   battery charge level is very low and may force lower power states
 *   even if there is activity.
 *
 *   NOTE: That these two steps are separated in time and, hence, the IDLE
 *   loop could be suspended for a long period of time between calling
 *   pm_checkstate() and pm_changestate().  The IDLE loop may need to make
 *   these calls atomic by either disabling interrupts until the state change
 *   is completed.
 *
 * Input Parameters:
 *
 * Returned Value:
 *   The recommended power management state.
